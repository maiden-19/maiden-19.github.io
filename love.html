						JOY.
						<br>
						My love for you is like a well-designed programming language - it's elegant, efficient, and it
						keeps evolving to become better with time. Just like code that never stops running, my affection
						for you is relentless and never-ending.
						<br>
						In the syntax of my heart, you are the most beautiful function. When I'm with you, life feels
						like a bug-free program with no runtime errors. Your smile is the semicolon that completes every
						line of my life, making it meaningful.
						<br>
						Our love is like a perfectly indented block of code, always structured and well-organized. You
						are the variable that holds the most significant value in my life, and I promise to protect and
						cherish you like the most precious data.
						<br>
						Just like a well-written algorithm, our love is efficient and brings the best results. There may
						be other fish in the sea, but you're the only one with whom I want to create a perfect loop,
						spending an eternity together.
						<br>
						So, let's continue to compile our love story, without any bugs or exceptions. With you, my love,
						life feels like the most optimized and error-free program, and I'm grateful for every line of
						code that we write together.
						<br>
						I can't believe it's been another amazing month on this incredible journey with you. Just like a
						well-optimized algorithm, our time together has been efficient and full of wonderful results.

						Our love is like a perfectly nested loop, continually iterating and getting better. Just as a
						program evolves with time, so does our connection. With every "iteration" of our monthsary, my
						love for you grows stronger.

						So, here's to us and our code of love. Cheers to many more months of happiness, endless loops of
						laughter, and the most efficient love story ever written. Happy Monthsary, my "if" that turned
						into a "while," and I can't wait to see what adventures await in the next month! I love you so
						much!
						<br>
						Your love,
						<br>
						Mark Denver
